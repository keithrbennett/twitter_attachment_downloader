# Twitter Attachment Downloader
#
# Twitter offers an archive of users' tweets, but this archive does not contain
# the attachments (such as photos).
#
# This script downloads the files and modifies the HTML and JavaScript so that
# when the archive is opened in a browser, the files are retrieved locally
# instead of from Twitter servers.

# Much/most of the logic has been copied from the Python script
# "Twitter export image fill 1.02" by Marcin Wichary (aresluna.org)
# at https://github.com/mwichary/twitter-export-image-fill
